## About the Game

*The True Ending* is an interactive journey where you guide a lone knight through a perilous dungeon. Unlike traditional controls, you don’t directly command the knight—instead, you influence his journey by carefully offering items and unlocking doors. Each choice you make sends the knight down a unique path, leading to multiple possible endings. Your choices determine if he finds glory, meets his doom, or reaches the elusive “true ending.”
